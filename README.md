# Gen-Z Dating App Behavior Analysis

## 1. Project Overview
In this project, we analyze the behavior and preferences of Gen-Z users on dating apps. Key areas of focus include:
- **Gender-Based Preferences**
- **Age-Related Usage Trends**
- **Regional and Temporal Behavior**
- **Feature Engineering for Predictive Modeling**

## 2. Key Insights and Observations

We derived the following insights from the dataset:

- **Age Group with Highest Activity**: The most active users fall within the *0.0 to 1.0 years* age range, revealing higher engagement than expected from the youngest users.
  
- **Daily Usage**: On average, Gen-Z users spend only *0.18 minutes per day* on dating apps, suggesting that their usage is brief but frequent.
  
- **Regional Insights**: Users in **metro areas** tend to engage with dating apps more actively than **rural users**.
  
- **Multiple App Usage**: A significant number of users engage with *multiple dating apps* simultaneously, indicating a preference for exploring multiple options.
  
- **Gender Differences**: Preliminary data suggests varying usage patterns based on gender, with some features being more engaging for one gender over the other.


## 3. Data Files and Documents
The following files are included for further review and analysis:

- **`feature_engineered_data.csv`**: The final dataset with all features processed for analysis.
- **`final_summary.csv`**: A summary of key metrics derived from the dataset.
- **`final_summary.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook with the detailed analysis and visualizations.


## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Data Collection
The data was gathered through a combination of user surveys and in-app tracking of Gen-Z users' behavior. Data points collected include:
- User **age**, **gender**, and **location**
- Frequency of **app usage**
- **Time spent** on the app daily
- Features interacted with, and the **number of apps** used simultaneously


### 4.2 Feature Engineering
We applied feature engineering to prepare the data for predictive modeling. Some of the key features included:
- Time-based usage patterns (e.g., peak activity hours)
- Multi-app usage behavior
- Geographical region (Metro vs. Rural)

### **Future Directions and Conclusion**

## 5. Future Directions and Recommendations

### 5.1 Enhanced Data Collection
There are gaps in data collection, particularly with underrepresented demographics. Expanding the sample size and ensuring diversity across **geographical regions** and **age groups** will provide more accurate and inclusive results.

### 5.2 User Experience Recommendations
Based on insights, dating apps can tailor features based on **regional engagement** and **multi-app usage**. For example, **metro users** might prefer more interactive or event-based features, while **rural users** might benefit from simplified experiences.

## 6. Conclusion
This analysis has provided a detailed look at how Gen-Z engages with dating apps, uncovering valuable insights into user preferences, behavior, and app usage trends. The findings point toward several areas for further investigation, such as predictive modeling and improving data representation. With these insights, dating app developers can refine their features and improve user experience.
